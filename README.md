# Hypothesis-Testing-
Descriptive statistics and Hypothesis testing


Project Overview:

This project is centered around hypothesis testing and statistical analysis using R, focusing primarily on estimating confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests for various population parameters. The provided dataset, stored in an Excel workbook, comprises diverse data types for analysis. The primary objective is to demonstrate proficiency in data processing using R, R Studio, and R Markdown while emphasizing hypothesis testing techniques.

Key Tasks:

Data Exploration: Present the first 15 observations of the dataset with a visually appealing table format using R's kableExtra package.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate and present the mean, median, and standard deviation for both the population and Sample 1 in a well-structured table.

Confidence Intervals (Sample 1): Calculate confidence intervals for the sample mean of Sample 1 at 90%, 96%, and 99% confidence levels. Assess if the population mean falls within these intervals.

Sample Size Determination: Calculate the required sample size for the confidence intervals obtained in the previous task.

Confidence Intervals (Sample 2): Similar to Task 3, calculate confidence intervals for the sample mean of Sample 2 (n < 30) at different confidence levels.

Proportions (Sample 3): Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the sample proportion of values lower than 1.7 in Sample 3 and interpret the results.

Variance (Sample 4): Determine 90%, 96%, and 99% confidence intervals for the sample variance in Sample 4 and assess if the population variance falls within these intervals.

Hypothesis Testing (Sample 5): Test the hypothesis that the population mean differs from 1.05 using Sample 5 (n = 200) with a two-tailed test. Calculate the necessary statistics and interpret the results. Focus on explaining the significance of hypothesis testing in drawing conclusions about population parameters.

P-Value Calculation: Calculate the corresponding p-value for the hypothesis test conducted in Task 8 and compare it with the significance level. Emphasize the interpretation of p-values and their importance in hypothesis testing.

Hypothesis Testing (Sample 6): Repeat hypothesis testing using Sample 6 (n = 29) to test if the population mean is higher than 1.05 with a one-tailed test at Î± = 0.01. Discuss the differences in approach due to the sample size and significance level.

Conclusion:

Provide a comprehensive conclusion summarizing the findings, interpretations, and any new insights gained throughout the project, with a particular focus on the implications of hypothesis testing results.
